# FastABC methodology for solving inverse problems 

Data and Python code repository to reproduce the results in chapter 4 and 5 of the thesis 
"Contributions to data-driven Bayesian solutions to inverse problems: from classical multivariate statistics to modern
generative neural networks" by Eliane Maalouf (University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland).

# Contents
- `01_geophysics_inverse_problem_docs/`: Contains the plots from the thesis chapter 4 and detailed results.
- `fastabc_inversion/`: Python package containing the code to run the FastABC inversion experiments.

# Experiments naming convention and reproducibility

## Usage

For convenience, we ran the scripts from the console of Pycharm IDE, but they can be easily adapted to run 
from the command line.
